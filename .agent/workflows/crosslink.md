description: This worklink helps to crosslink the post to other past posts
---

When this workflow is initiated, check the content of the current post and see all the past posts which are written in the website. Find out where you can cross-link the current post text with past post hyperlink.

- Always remember hyperlink should be given in Zola friendly format which is
[current post text](@/path/file.md)
- Do not link a past post more than once.
- Do not add hyperlink of the posts where draft = true
