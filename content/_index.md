I'm Soumendra Kumar Sahoo, a software engineer from India. I'm currently working as a Lead MLOps/System Engineer at [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com/). I love to build things and I'm passionate about open-source software. I am a backend software dev with a focus on Python and JavaScript. I kind of consider myself as a full-stack developer.

When I'm not working, I like to play chess, walk, and write about my experiences.
