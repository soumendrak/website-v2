I'm Soumendra Kumar Sahoo, a software engineer from Bengaluru, India. I'm currently working as a Lead MLOps/System Engineer at [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com/). I am also working as a part-time AI Consultant. I have 12+ years of experience in the field of software engineering. I have started my career as a COBOL/Mainframe developer. You can find my resume [here](@/resume.md).

I love to build and break latest tools and techs. I'm passionate about open-source software. Due to this I have made my hands dirty in LLMs, RAGs, DevOps, Full Stack Engineering, No Code development tools, Technical writing, Blockchain, Quantum Computing, IoT etc.

I am M.Tech in Data Science and Engineering from [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) where my thesis was on LLM alignment. I have co-authored an IEEE paper on LLM fine-tuning, I have a patent pending and I have contributed to many [open-source projects](@/projects/_index.md).

When I'm not working, I like to play chess, walk, and write about my experiences. 
I love to help people in any way I can. If you need any help on career, project, portfolio, etc. please feel free to [reach out](@/contact.md) to me.
