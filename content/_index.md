I'm Soumendra Kumar Sahoo, an AI Observability Architect and AI Sustainability Lead at PepsiCo, bringing over 12 years of enterprise technology leadership experience. At PepsiCo, I spearhead strategic initiatives in AI governance, focusing on system optimization, ethical compliance, and sustainable AI practices. 

With expertise spanning artificial intelligence, and AI transformation, I specialize in leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex business challenges. My work encompasses Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and full-stack engineering solutions.

I hold an M.Tech in Data Science and Engineering from BITS Pilani, where my research focused on LLM alignment. My contributions to the field include an IEEE-published paper on LLM fine-tuning, a pending patent, and significant involvement in multiple [open-source projects](@/projects/_index.md). You can find my detailed professional background [here](@/resume.md).

Based in Hyderabad, India I maintain a strong commitment to technology innovation and knowledge sharing. I welcome connections with fellow technology leaders and innovators - feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/soumendrak/) to discuss technology trends, strategic initiatives, or collaborative opportunities.
