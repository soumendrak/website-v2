You have started implementing AI in your organization. Are you facing following challenges?

- `RAG Quality`: Your Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is not delivering the expected quality of responses. Sometimes it provides irrelevant or incorrect information, leading to user frustration and decreased trust in the system. Maybe you are unsure whether you can make it public facing.
- `Observability`: You are struggling to monitor and understand the performance of your AI systems. The lack of observability makes it difficult to identify issues, optimize performance, and ensure that the AI models are functioning as intended.
- `LLM Evaluation`: You are struggling to evaluate the performance of your Large Language Models (LLMs). The metrics you currently use do not provide a clear picture of how well the models are performing in real-world scenarios, making it difficult to identify areas for improvement. You have used LLM-as-a-Judge and it is burning a hole in your pocket.

I can help you with these challenges. With over 13 years of experience in AI and enterprise technology, I specialize in AI observability, RAG quality improvement, and LLM evaluation.
