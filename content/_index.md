## Expert AI Consulting for Real-World Challenges

Is your organization facing these AI implementation challenges?

### RAG Quality Issues
Your Retrieval-Augmented Generation system isn't delivering reliable responses, causing user frustration and trust issues. You need expert guidance to make it production-ready.

### Limited AI Observability
Without proper monitoring systems, you're struggling to track AI performance, identify issues, and optimize your models effectively.

### Costly LLM Evaluation
Your current LLM evaluation approach is expensive and doesn't provide clear insights into real-world performance. You need a more efficient, cost-effective solution.


I can help you with these challenges. With over 13 years of experience in AI and enterprise technology, I specialize in AI observability, RAG quality improvement, and LLM evaluation.
