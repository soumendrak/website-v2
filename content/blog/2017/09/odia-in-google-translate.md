You can provide feedback to Google to add Odia and consider you have done your job.

OR

Take responsibility of your language and join Google translate community to convert possible English phrases to Odia phrases.
In this way the Odia language corpus will increase and Google will have enough data to add our language to the Home page.

Here is one of my translation screenshot

Edit:

On another note, there is a Twitter handle called [Shua](https://twitter.com/mte2o) started collecting parallel pairs for an automated Machine Translation service from English to Odia. You may follow it.
