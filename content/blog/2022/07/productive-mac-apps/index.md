I have been using a MacBook pro since the end of 2019. These are the different apps I use which are super productive for me:

- [Krisp](https://krisp.ai/)
  - Krisp’s AI-powered solution removes background noise and echoes from meetings, leaving only a human voice.
  - Every day you get **60 minutes** of free noise cancellation from your microphone and speaker.
  - It really does noise cancellation well, very well.
- [RayCast](https://www.raycast.com/)
  - RayCast is your Mac's personal assistant. It is a spotlight on steroids.
  - Earlier I was using Alfred. However, the RayCast personal free version provides many more features than the free version of Alfred.
- [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/)
  - The feature-rich, fast, and free best screenshot tool ever.
  - It can annotate, pixelate, measure pixel distance scroll screenshots, and many more.
  - You won't regret installing it.
- [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net)
  - I use Thunderbird as my all-in-one email client.
- [LanguageTool - Online Grammar, Style & Spell Checker](https://languagetool.org/)
  - Alternative to Grammarly: almost all features and cheaper.
- [f.lux: software to make your life better (](https://justgetflux.com/)[justgetflux.com](https://justgetflux.com)[)](https://justgetflux.com/)
  - Screen color changer for betterment of eyes
- [Espanso - A Privacy-first, Cross-platform Text Expander](https://espanso.org/)
  - An ultimate productivity tool to save typing characters.
- [AppCleaner (](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)[freemacsoft.net](https://freemacsoft.net)[)](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/)
  - Deletes all residual files from Apps.
