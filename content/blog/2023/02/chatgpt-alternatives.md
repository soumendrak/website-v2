We will discuss the upcoming LLMs (Large Language Models like ChatGPT) in 2023.

## **Claude** by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)

- As per their [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf), it is a 52B parameter, Autoregressive pre-trained model.
- Made by ex-OpenAI employees, Google has [invested $300 million](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/3/23584540/google-anthropic-investment-300-million-openai-chatgpt-rival-claude) in this startup to get a 10% stake in the company and make 'Google cloud' the preferred one for Claude. (ChatGPT uses Microsoft Azure)
- Check out this article for a detailed response comparison with Claude's initial version and chatGPT.

## **Bard** by Google

- [Google is under pressure from investors](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/03/google-best-yet-to-come-ai-journey-faces-potential-disruption-openai-chatgpt/) to release its ChatGPT equivalent. Also, Microsoft's rival search engine, Bing, plans to incorporate GPT-4 into its search experience.
- LaMDA, the [sentient chatbot](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61784011), can help Google address these concerns, and CEO Sundar Pichai is already [working on it](https://www.techradar.com/news/google-is-ready-to-take-on-chatgpt-and-well-see-its-ai-masterplan-any-day-now).

## **Sparrow** by Deepmind:

- Sparrow is a [research model](https://medium.com/illumination/secrets-of-deepminds-sparrow-a-big-competitor-of-chatgpt-9838a90cefb8) and proof of concept designed with the goal of training dialogue agents to be more helpful, correct, and harmless. It is not publicly available and is used for research purposes.

## **Ernie** by Baidu

- Ernie, an acronym for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, has been developing since 2019.
- Internal testing will complete [in March](https://www.techspot.com/news/97522-china-baidu-launch-chatgpt-style-service-called-ernie.html). Initially, it will be launched as a standalone App before integrating with the Baidu search engine.

## Stability AI:

- They are working on an open-source ChatGPT.

With the rise of LLMs, users will have more choices, which is a good thing. So let's see who can have extra features, reliable infra, and fine-tuned answers based on the need of the users.
