In this era of attention seekers, I find RSS feeds to be a valuable tool for staying up-to-date with the latest news and updates of the persons you follow and the projects you care about.

## What is RSS?
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a format for syndicating web content. It is a simple XML-based format that allows you to subscribe to updates from a website or blog.

## How does RSS work?
RSS works by allowing you to subscribe to a website's RSS feed, which is a list of the latest updates from that website. When you subscribe to an RSS feed, you can receive updates from that website in the form of a feed, which is a list of the latest updates from that website.

## Why use RSS?
RSS is a valuable tool for staying up-to-date with the latest news and updates of the persons you follow and the projects you care about.

## How to use RSS?
You can use RSS readers like Feedly, Inoreader, and The Old Reader to subscribe to RSS feeds and receive updates from the websites you follow.

I use [Karakeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep) (earlier known as Hoarder) to subscribe to RSS feeds and receive updates from the websites I follow. I self host this reader at [PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/). Earlier, I used Readwise and before that Omnivore. Readewise became too costly after my student discount got over and Omnivore is not there anymore.

## Feeds I subscribe to
