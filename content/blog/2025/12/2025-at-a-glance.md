This year I have learnt many life experiences especially on the personal front. On my last breaths when I will rewind my life, 2025 will be remembered for sure.

## Highlights
- For the first time I have met with any of my employer's CEO. I met PepsiCo CEO, [Ramon Laguarta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramonlaguarta/). He shook hands with me and thanked me for my work. Memory of the year? Decade?
- I have become a [judge in a hackathon](https://www.soumendrak.com/blog/hydpyhack2025/) for the first time. The experience of being a participant was better for me than being a judge.
- I moved my VPS (Virtual Private Server) from DigitalOcean to a cheaper alternative, Hetzner.
- I have gained the experiences of [making reels](https://www.youtube.com/@SoumendraSahooAIGuy). This year I have moved outdoors in parks, rooftops, desk and all to shoot reels on AI. In that brief period 4 persons were involved behind the camera and It is tougher than it looks.
- The best book I have read this year is [The 5 Types of Wealth - Sahil Bloom](https://www.the5typesofwealth.com/). This book helped me shift my focus a bit from my work and take care of the other aspects of life.
- I have learnt car driving, got Driver's license and drove around 500 KM/50hrs in 6 months to prepare for the DL test. Surprisingly, my two wheeler driving got improved after I have implemented my four wheeler driving lessons there. #TransferLearning
- I have moved to Hyderabad in Dec 2024. If I compare my experiences in cities other than my hometown on descending order: Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru.
- In this year I understood clearly that I love teaching; more than teaching I love more the process of anticipating student questions and preparing for those.
- In total I have given sessions both internally at PepsiCo and outside on diverse set of topics:
	- AI Observability
	- Opentelemetry
	- Self Hosting
	- n8n
	- RAG
	- AI Agents
	- Context Engineering
	- Indian Income Tax across salary, business, and rest other income heads.
	- Basics of share market.
- These are a few projects I have tried this year:
	1. Mapped the street lights of where do I stay at OpenStreetMap. How did it in 2024, you can [read here](https://www.soumendrak.com/blog/street-lamp-diwali/).
	2. Replaced package manager as `uv` in the [openodia](https://github.com/soumendrak/openodia) project. Adding MCP tool is in progress.
	3. Last year in 2024, I have moved my website from Notion to this Zola based website. This year I have settled on the Tabi theme and made many fine tuning to the site.
	4. I have started my physical server [self hosting journey](https://www.soumendrak.com/blog/self-hosting/) with a Beelink mini PC. This is also the first time I have ordered something of a significant amount from Indiamart on the recommendation of an LLM (Gemini) for the first time.
	5. I have stopped making slides for my talks and have been using Lovable to create slide websites for my talks like [RAG](http://rag.soumendrak.com/) and [OTel](https://o11y.soumendrak.com/).
	6. I have started writing an auto-biography. I have also started maintaining a family tree with the help of [Gramps](https://gramps-project.org/); I have added 246 people and 87 families so far.

## Lessons Learnt

1. No matter how good a person is, in this world if there is a chance that you can commit a crime with very less chance of getting caught, maximum people will do the crime. The thing is you should never trust anyone blindly. Trust but ALWAYS verify. No matter how much you trust, give the other person a hint that you are looking them.
2. From 2022 onwards I was using significant help from LLMs to write down my blog posts. However, towards the later part of this year, I have realized that the world has been full of LLM content. I did not stop using LLMs but I have significantly changed how I used LLMs to write blog posts.
3. Part of my workplace bandwidth demanded Engineering manager respnsibilities, [the effective manager](https://www.amazon.in/dp/1394181612) book helped a lot to strengthen the fundamentals. I highly recommend this if you are transitioning from IC to EM role.
4. The gap between domain knowledge acquisition and application are getting narrowed every year. Better to start applying the accumulated knowledge.

## 2026 roadmap

- I will not be having any new year resolution. The mantra is to take every day as a new blessing and keep helping others.
- I have created a process of planning phase every weekend to get the broader picture on where I am going and execution phase on rest of the weekdays.
