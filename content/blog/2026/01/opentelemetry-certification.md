## Background
The last time I appeared on any proctored exam for certification was four years back in 2021 when I got my [AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty - Credly](https://www.credly.com/badges/abd00b47-bde3-438f-bb18-5bdccd7c87ba/public_url) certificate and which was already expired in 2024.

I had known Observability as a phase in MLOps when I was in Freshworks. I joined PepsiCo as an AI Observability Architect. Therefore, I have to build the acumen to live up to my designation. Certifications are easy way to showcase your skillsets. Therefore, I did a bunch of AI Observability certifications from Arize. Then I have done a certificate on OpenTelemetry called Getting started with OpenTelemetry back in Jun 2025. 

## 50% Black Friday Discount
The next stage of that free certification was OTCA certificate which is a paid one and the only one in OTel. In general it costs 250 USD. It was too much but this was under my radar for quite some time. On Black Friday I got to know that they are giving some discounts and I got the certificate in 50% discount at 125 USD. I had no clue if I will be able to complete the certificate or not. I was just convinced that if you want to stay in this domain then I have to do this certificate.

## Preparation
With that I planned to prepare for this during the year end holidays. I have followed the following plan initially till the first attempt:
1. Revisiting the course of [Getting Started With OpenTelemetry](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/courses/getting-started-with-opentelemetry-lfs148) especially its GitHub repo, this is the only free course Linux Foundation has on OTel.
2. Taking the help from Google Gemini to create mock exams using its canvas feature.
3. Going through some YouTube tutorials.

I could not give the exam on the year end as the new year vibe ruined it and I was occupied with connecting my [self-hosted jellyfin server](@/blog/2025/12/self-hosting.md) to my TV which were 1000 KMs away from each other.

## Scheduling Exam
You can schedule the exam 24hrs after the current time till the end of 90 days from today. There was no limited slot. Therefore, I decided to book it in a Tatkal train ticket booking style just before the exam day i.e. 10th Jan 2026. I booked the exam at the night time at 10:30PM. I revisited my notes. Run the codes and got ready for the exam day.

## Proctored Exam
You need to join the exam link 30 mins before the exam time i.e. 10 PM in my case. Post joining a proctor will join and will discuss with you in Chat. Oh! boy after this AI revolution the definition of proctored exam has changed completely. It was not like this when I gave the AWS ML Specialty exam in 2021. The proctor checked the followings:
1. I used my webcam to show my desk
2. Everything I have kept on my desk like my keyboard, mousepad, laptop I rotated and shown them nothing is below that.
3. A water bottle with no labels/stickers.
4. Behind my monitor
5. Under my desk
6. 360 degree view of my room with me standing and giving them my room tour.
7. My ceiling and my floor
8. Clearing all headphones and extra laptop.
9. Closing the doors so that nobody can enter.
10. Putting my webcam on my ears so that they will be sure that I do not have any earpiece.
11. Showing them my glasses so that they will get confirmed that it is not a smart glass.
12. It is not allowed to put your hands in front of your mouth.
12. You can do lipsync or even read the questions.
13. You can not see here and there.
14. Your complete face should be visible to the webcam all the time; do not go too near to the question. *I got a warning here*.
15. At the end show them on another mobile how the webcam looks like.

## Heartbreak
I got some errors while installing the custom browser; the error appreared again and finally I just closed the error pop up and it worked.
There were 60 questions and 90 minutes. I can afford to make 15 questions wrong to pass.
First time I attempted the exam I scored 73%. The passing mark was 75%. I think I gave it wrong on one or two questions. Immediately, I got an email that I could not make it and it said me how to to retake the exam.

It hurts a lot when you miss the passing mark by just 2%. I was feeling so low and was about go to depression the whole night, then I remembered one scene from [Bhaag Milkha Bhaag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaag_Milkha_Bhaag) where Milkha Singh got selected even if he just failed due to a sharp stone while running.
Which changed my thought process that I did not fail by 2% , I failed by 27%. Score a 100% such that the cut-off will not scare you anymore.

With this thought process I rebooked the exam then and there, it was too late so the earliest slot I got was 12:30AM. I booked it. I knew that if I will not be able to do it this weekend then I will not be able to do it next weekend or after 3 months. I have so many things to do and I do not want to wait for this certification. I have already spent my year end holidays preparing for this.

## Second and Final Attempt Preparation
- As soon as I got the email that I failed, I have noted down all the questions where I was confused with the options which were available. I could not remember all but I got around 22 questions. This reminded me of the days when I used to give medical entrace exams. Our coaching centre staff after the PMT/JEE exams used to give us a piece of paper and asking to write down the questions and options which we remembered. By this they used to get all the questions by crownsourcing from the candidates. On the next day, there were questions with answer keys on newspaper gets published.
- I have cloned the documentation github repo of OTel directly and with these questions written in a file. Asked Claude Code to find the answers and the citations. I got all the answers and their explanations.
- I also searched a bit more and remembered back then I used to get practice exam papers from Udemy. I got a 6 set practice exam from there by 399 INR. I scored the same 73% there. There were so many incorrect responses. It felt frustrated at first but then I convinced myself the more incorrect responses I get here, the lesser I will get at the exam. *The more you sweat, the lesser you will bleed.* 

![Incorrect responses](/images/posts/OTCA/3.webp)
Frankly speaking just an hour before the exam I should not have attempting these practice exams, it kind of added frustration and unnecessary brain energy was getting drained. I had to watch a few mindless reels to comeback to normal state.

## The now or never exam
In a winter night 12AM when every where is silent except the dogs, I login to the portal. Last time I was going through each and every question serially from 1 to 60. This time, as soon as I see a long question or a question I thought need more thinking I flagged those for review.
In that way I have gone rounds and rounds of iteration on the flagged questions reducing those on each round.
Finally, I counted how many questions I was unsure, I got 12 out of 60. Which made me confident that I will get passed this time.
In schools I had a habit of giving the answer sheets just 5 mins before exam end time. I did the same this time. 
Finally, I refreshed my email multiple times and saw the result at the portal.
I got 88% this time.

As soon as the results appear, street dogs bark exactly at the same time to celebrate.
