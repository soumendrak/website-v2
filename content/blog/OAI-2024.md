## Initial days of the conference
Somewhere in the month of August 2024, there was a proposal to be a physical conference in Bhubaneswar under the name of OdishaAI.
However, due to conflict of interests this was not possible.
I was completely of the radar and switched myself into read-only mode due to extreme work pressure from other responsibilities.

On September 2024, virual conference was proposed. The date was finalized long back as 5th October 2024.
I was pretty frustrated with the website of the OdishaAI, the website was in plain HTML and CSS without any templating. Every page was needed to be built from scratch with zero reusability.
On top of it there were not much volunteers to help me out as well. I decided to switch to a static site generator and started working on it.
I chose Zola to be the static site generator and started working on it. As I had already moved with the `Tabi` theme for my personal blog, I used the same theme.
I built the website and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. As my role as webstie maintainer became less chaotic, I started to focus on the conference.

This 2024 conference was decided to be 33hrs long continous marathon conference. The last conference we had was 12hrs long. This was a huge leap. The program schedule was the biggest challenge.
We had to keep a sweet spot between the speakers and gap in between. We had to keep the audience engaged.
This year also we have decided to switch to Google Meet for the conference. The last conference we had was on Zoom.
I have prepared an SOP for the hosts to follow during the conference.

* The SOP should be prepared for the hosts.
