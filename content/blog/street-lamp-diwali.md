**TL;DR**: This post is about how I have tried to create a deepak just before the Diwali on the open street map by adding all the street lamps [near my area](https://sb12.github.io/OSMStreetLight/#15/13.0065/77.5559) in 2024.

## Street Lamps
Street lamps plays an important role towards the safety. Street lamps gives confidence and reduces nuances in a neighbourhood. It also increases visibility while driving. By watching the street lamps on the [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/21.84/82.79) before going on the street makes a person confident.
It also helps how developed a neighbourhood is.

## Inspiration
In 2024, I got introduced to OSM Bengaluru Telegram channel. There I came across a post where Prasanna was mapping street lamps on the OSM.

*Does it look like a deepak?*

## Background efforts
- I have walked one street lamp at a time and mapped all these street lamps manually. There were instances when I walked 3 KMs on a single go. 
- All these lamps are color mapped; there are yellow and white lamps. 
- I travelled these areas post sunset to make sure all the lamps are in working condition.

## Acknowledgements
I moved to Hyderabad. I hope someone will take forward the tasks I left at Bengaluru to the next level. Here is a thank you note:
- I thank all the volunteers of OSM who mapped the roads and buildings to make it easy for me to place the lamps.
- I would also like to thank the developers of [Every Door](https://github.com/Zverik/every_door) app without which placing the lamps on the map would not have been easier.
- Finally, I would like to thank [Prasanna Venkadesh](https://prasannavenkadesh.github.io/blog/osm-contributions.html) whose post in OSM Bengaluru group inspired me to start this.
