Please cover the following areas before your interview:

1. You should be able to define basic electrical terminologies like current, transformer, Kirchoff's laws, Voltage etc. They will not ask you to solve problems or answer long questions.
2. Be sound on different types of sorting mechanisms like Insertion, Merge, Bubble sort.
3. If you mention you know C++ or Java they will ask you about difference between C, C++, Java etc. However, if you do not mention C++ or Java that is absolutely fine.
4. Basic C questions for loop, value of x after x++ and ++x after various loops etc.
5. Be specific with your answers. Show confidence to them. Even if you think the answer is incorrect, you should be confident.
6. Stress test may happen. They may ask a lot of 'why' to your answer.
7. Why are you interested in IT? Did you attend any previous interview before? Why did you/ didn't you get select?
8. They will ask you about your hobby and you should be able to prove them that. Fake hobbies from friends will not work.
9. Do not ask each and every person coming out of the interview what questions asked to them. Questions change.
10. Always prepare before going to an interview. Do not give a shit if the interview did not go well. Keep the same smiling face with you and return. Some interviewers look how are you leaving from the interview.

All the best.
