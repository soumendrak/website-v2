# uBlock Origin

- You can remove the Ads from [YouTube.com](https://youtube.com) by just installing an AdBlocker in your browser.
- I recommend the open-source AdBlocker [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).

# Video Speed Controller

- [Video Speed Controller](https://github.com/igrigorik/videospeed) enables you to go beyond 2x speed; you can watch boring lectures faster by using this extension.
- It also works on any video playing on your browser besides YouTube.

# FreeTube

- [FreeTube](https://github.com/FreeTubeApp/FreeTube) is a YT desktop client (not a browser extension) built around using YT more privately.
- You can enjoy your favorite content and creators without your habits being tracked and Ads.
- You do not need to sign in but can import your subscriptions.

# SponsorBlock

- [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) is an open-source crowdsourced browser extension for skipping sponsor segments in YT videos.
- Users submit when a sponsor happens from the extension, and the extension automatically skips sponsors.
