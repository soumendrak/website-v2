## What I learned
- You can use [opengraph.dev](https://opengraph.dev/panel?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.soumendrak.com%2Fblog%2F2026%2F01%2Fai-in-the-adult-industry%2F) to see how your [website post link](@/blog/2026/01/ai-in-the-adult-industry/index.md) will look like on different social media.
- A [20 TB external HDD](@/blog/2025/12/self-hosting/index.md) desktop cost 41k INR and 24TB external HDD costs its double 80k INR. In the USA 20TB costs less than 30k INR.

## What failed

## What I built
- Made all my job interview notes (still a few left) to a separate series for easy accesability, called [Job Interviews](@/series/job-interviews/_index.md).
- [Rybbit](https://github.com/rybbit-io/rybbit) has been the best alternate Google Analytics so far. I moved from [Umami](@/blog/2025/12/self-hosting/index.md) to Rybbit. 
    - I liked the UX so much that I made [a donation](https://github.com/sponsors/goldflag) to the developer.
    - You can see this website's analytics [here](https://rybbit.ekathi.com/1/main?timeMode=day&bucket=hour&stat=users&wellKnown=today).
    - I got sold on the Globe view. I have a weakness to [maps](@/projects/osm.md) from childhood.
