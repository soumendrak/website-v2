### For Individuals
- 87A rebate limit increased from 25 lakhs to 7 lakhs (for new tax regime) + Slab rates changed

## Tax basics
- A total of 50% of income Govt is from Income tax.

## I-T Act
- Sections, Sub-sections, Chapters
- Govt. creates new rules for Finance Act in the Budget for the umbrella I-T Act, which CBDT executes.
  
## Income
- Two types:
    - Revenue: Salary, Dividend, Rent, Interest → Kind of regular income
        - Taxable unless made exempt
    - Capital: Capital gain on Property sale, Gift/Loan
        - Exempt unless specifically made Taxable
## FY and AY
- We earn in FY; the Govt takes from us on AY.
- Always subtract one year from AY to get the FY. If AY is 2021-22, FY is 2020-21.
  
## Residential Status
### Who is Resident Indian
- A: If you are in India for more than 182 days or
- B: Current FY 60 days + last four years total stay more than 365 days, then you are a Resident Indian.
- B is not applicable for seafarers, only A.
### Tax Applicability
- A Resident Indian is liable to pay their Global Income taxes in India.
- An NR Indian must pay only their Indian income taxes in India, not global income.
![[Attachments/Untitled 3 44.png|Untitled 3 44.png]]
  
## Accrued Income
- Income earned in India by an NR means Income accrued in India. The NR needs to pay tax on the income. The German consultant came to Utkal Tannery for factory Quality control.
- Similarly, an Infosys guy on a three-monthly trip to the USA, whatever s/he will earn will be income accrued outside India and taxable in India.  
      
    
![[Attachments/Untitled 4 40.png|Untitled 4 40.png]]
IAI: Income Accrued in India, IAOI: IA Outside India, IRI: Income Received in India, IROI: IR Outside IN
## Tax break
Three types are there
1. Exemption
    1. Agricultural Income → Exempted
    2. Salary Income → Not exempted
2. Deduction
    1. 50,000 deduction in salaried income
3. Rebate
    1. It is applied to Tax payable, not Taxable Income, unlike the other two above.
    2. If your income is < 5 Lakhs, the minimum tax of 12,500 will be a tax rebate.
## Tax Rate
Two rates are there:
1. Normal Rate: Salary → 30%
2. Special Rate:
    1. Short-term Capital Gain → 15%
    2. Long-term CG → 10%
    3. Real Estate long-term CG → 20%
    4. Casual Income/Lottery → 30%
- Final Tax Liability = (Normal Rate Tax + Special Rate Tax) + Surcharge + CESS
  
## Payment of Tax Liability
### TDS
- The employer pays the Govt by deducting the salary of the Employee.
- You may have other incomes like Dividends, Capital gain; based on that, we need to file ITR.
### Advanced Tax
- You must pay progressive tax if the net tax liability is more than 10,000 in an FY.
- The due dates are like below. In this case, suppose you have to pay 1 lakh tax.

    |15 / 12|75%|75,000|
    |15 / 3|100%|1,00,000|
    
- Senior citizens (> 60 yrs) is not needed to pay advanced taxes.
  
### Self Assessment Tax

### House Property Scenarios
Danish has a salary of 10 lakhs, with an HRA of 2 lakhs.
He has both an SO and a Rented property.
- He is giving House loan Interest for SO and Rental 2,50,000 and 3,00,000, respectively.
- House loan principal he is paying as 40k and 60k w.r.t SO and RP.
- He is getting 2,75,000 rent from the rental property.
What is his taxable income?
- Standard deduction: 50k
- For SO:
    - HRA supposes the least of all 4 is two lakhs itself.
    - Negative income: 2 lakhs
    - Principal: 40,000 → 80C
    - SO income: -4 lakhs 40 thousand
- For RP:
    - Negative Income: 2 Lakhs
    - Income: 2,75,000
    - Principal: 60,000 → 80c
    - RP income: 75,000 - 60k = 15,000
Taxable income =
10,00,000 - (50,000 + 4,40,000 ) + 15,000 = 5,25,000
### NPS
There are three sections:
- 80CCD(1) → Employee
- 80CCD(1B) → Employee
- 80CCD(2) → Employer
    - There is no upper cap exemption limit here; Except
    - 10% of your BA + DA is the cap for non-govt and 14% for govt. Employees.
Limit:
- 80C + 80CCC + 80CCD(1) = 1,50,000 maximum
Taxability:
- Tier-1: Non-taxable
- Tier-II: Taxable
- Before Retirement:
    - Partial withdrawal: 25% Non-taxable
    - Up to 20% of Corpus can be withdrawn in a lump sum. Tax-free.
    - If Corpus < Rs.1 lac, then the employee can withdraw the entire corpus
- At Retirement:
    - 60% lumpsum at the time of retirement: Non-taxable
    - Other 40% at the time of retirement, i.e., pension, Annuity Scheme: Taxable
    - The employee can withdraw the entire corpus if Corpus < Rs. 2 lac.
- Once the employee exits the scheme, he cannot rejoin the scheme.
Partial Withdrawal Rules:==[Conflicting references are there; need to verify]==
- NPS member for a minimum of 10 years
- A maximum 25% withdrawal of **your total contribution** is allowed.
- Only THREE times in a lifetime partial withdrawal is allowed.
Upon exit at retirement age defined by the Company, Employee gets following  
flexibilities:  
- Defer the Annuity investment for three years from retirement age OR
- Defer the Corpus withdrawal till 70 years of age OR
- Withdraw Corpus in lumpsum or installments (max 10) OR
- Keep on investing in NPS till 70 years of age.
If the Employee opts to defer investment in Annuity or withdrawal, the amount remains invested and keeps growing.
Suggestion:
- First fill 80CCD(1B) to reach 50k cap
- Then go for 80CCD(1) if you have contributed more than 50k in NPS.

    - Shares
    - Artwork
    - Drawing/Painting
    - Sculptures
- Car and A/C are not gifts from PoV of I-T.
  
Exempt:
- From specified persons/relatives
- Who are called relatives?
    1. Spouse of the individual;
    2. brother or sister of the individual;
    3. brother or sister of the spouse of the individual;
    4. brother or sister of either of the parents of the individual;

        1. Children, Grandchildren, Parents, Grandparent, Great grandparents
        2. Not children of daughter
        3. Not the parents of the mother
    6. any lineal ascendant or descendant of the spouse of the individual;
        1. Parents-in-law, Grandparents-in-law
    7. spouse of the person referred to in clauses (2) to (6);
- On Special events like Weddings, gifts are exempt.
- What are the events:
    1. From any relative; or
    2. on the occasion of the marriage of the individual; or
    3. under a will or by way of inheritance; or
    4. in contemplation of the death of the payer or donor, as the case may be; or
    5. from any local authority as defined in the Explanation to Clause (20) of Section 10; or
    6. from any fund or foundation or university or other educational institution or hospital or
    7. Other medical institutions or
    8. any trust or institution referred to in clause (23C) of section10; or
    9. from or by any trust or institution registered under 72 [section 12A or section 12AA or section 12AB or
Non-exempt:
- From non-specified persons. However, there are a few exceptions to this like:
    - Gift amount ≤ 50,000
        - Aggregation happens
    - Real estate stamp duty value ≤ 50,000
        - Here aggregation does not happen.
    - For other assets also ≤ 50,000
        - Aggregation happens
- In the case of aggregation, if we cross the 50k limit under a category in an FY, the whole gifted amount will be taxable. E.g., if you receive 40k from A and 15k from B, the whole 55k will be taxable; there will be no 50k deduction and a 5k taxable concept here.
- On Non-special events
Further suggestions:
- Keep receipts of the gifts as usually, I-T notice comes after 3-4 years of FY.
- If we take 2 Lakhs or more in cash from any person (relative or non-relative), the entire amount becomes a penalty.
### Clubbing Provisions
Section 64

> [!important]  
> Total Income = Ch IV + Ch V - (Ch VI - Ch VI A)  
- Income received thru spouse, parents, or minor comes back to the club in your income.
- The interest income received through minors gets a 1500 exemption.
- Suppose your FIL deposits some amount in your daughter’s name, which earns an income. Then the income will be clubbed to the parent with the highest income, and it remains the same until the daughter ceases to exist as a minor, even if the highest earner parents change later.
### Acceptance and Repayment of Loan
- Any loan from any person worth more than 20,000 in cash, then the entire amount will become taxable.
- While repaying this loan, the entire amount will become a penalty if you again pay it back in cash.

- Without breaking I-T rules if we can minimize taxable income and maximize return.
- Assuming NIL interest and penalty.
**Tax Avoidance**
- Without knowing if you made a mistake.
**Tax Evasion**
- Deliberately not informing I-T on income.
- This is illegal and may cost a penalty once found out in the future.
  
### Tax Planning Modes
Best 80C channels
- PPF → E E E
    - PPF is a good option even in the age of low return age as today due to its EEE option. It can be contributed even if the 1,50,000 cap has already crossed.
    - For minors’ you can start PPF account early for them so that just when they cease to be minors they have access to PPF withdrawal.
- NSC
    - Till 5 years all interests received are non-taxable, but from 6th year it become taxable as the scheme matures in 5 years.
- SSY
    - All interests are exempt. It comes under EEE.
    - Both PPF and SSY for a child is possible.
