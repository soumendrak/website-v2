## About project

### Problem
I have invested in share market across multiple broker apps and markets. There was no easy and free way to consolidate all my investements with near real time update. 

### Solution
To resolve this issue, I have leveraged Google Sheets to see all my portfolio investments across different markets.
This is a template which can be leveraged by others if they want. I have fine tuned this version across many years adding one feature at a time. I am publishing it to the public  completely free, no strings attached. Just make a copy and use.
