PRs are not the only way to contribute. I also engage with the community through discussions, issue reporting, and providing feedback on other contributions. Those I do not know how to quantify.

I will try to keep track of these contributions in the future to better showcase my involvement in the open source community.
Open source is the best way to learn, collaborate, and make a positive impact on the software ecosystem.
