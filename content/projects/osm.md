## About project

OpenStreetMap Foundation is a non-profit organization that supports the development of OpenStreetMap, a free and open-source map of the world. The OSMF is a community-driven organization that works to improve the quality and usability of OpenStreetMap data and tools.

I joined OSM back in 2018. Then, there was a movement to use alternatives to Google products. For Google Maps, I found OSM.
Recently, in 2023, I finally started contributing to OSM seriously and continuously. Within around 50 days of contributions, I had become a member of the OSM foundation and one of the top 5 mappers in India.

## Contributions

- I have been contributing to the OSM Foundation for the past two years and have made significant contributions to the OSM community.

  - Mapped [over 3500 kilometers](https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1Qns) of roads in India.
  - Mapped 75% of the buildings in Bhubaneswar[^1].
