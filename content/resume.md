## About Me

As a Lead System Engineer at Freshworks, I work on removing roadblocks, scaling up, and adding new features to the Freddy AI platform. I have over 11 years of experience developing and leading AI solutions and transformations for various industries and domains.

As an AI Consultant, I advise startups on defining the problems, scoping the requirements, and finding the right tools to solve the problems within a specific time frame.

I am passionate about solving societal problems through technology and believe in giving back to the community. I volunteer at Mozilla Common Voice to build a text-to-speech corpus on a low-resource language, create and edit Wikipedia pages to maintain unbiased data, and contribute to many open-source projects on GitHub. I also love to code, guide developers, and teach students and graduates.
